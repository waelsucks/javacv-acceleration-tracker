# Human Acceleration Tracker with JavaCV: Real-time People Detection and Acceleration Analysis

In this project, we use JavaCV to detect individuals within a video feed. Through JavaCV's rectangle annotations, we calculate the acceleration of each detected person by analyzing the changes in the areas of these rectangles.
